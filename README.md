# OpenGLCTRender

Introduction:
This project is used to study OpenGL and do the whole rendering.  
It starts take obj file from fiji 3d viewer.  
Thanks to http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/.  
And my professor, TA and friends.  

Demo.cpp is the main function.  
test.cpp is the main function used to add and test new function.  
img folder is some sample generated by fiji 3d viewer.  
dependencies folder includes GLFW, GLEW and GLM.  

How to plat:  
Scroll mouse to scale model.  
Click the mouse and move it to rotate model.  
↑↓←→ up, down, left and right.  

Pipeline:
Initialization:
1.  Initialize GLEW, GLFW and glm.
2.  Create a background.
3.  Load vertex shader and fragment shader.
4.  Create MVP, view and model matrix.
5.  Load cube.obj to get vertices.
6.  Scale down vertices and get pivot.
7.  Calculate weighted vertex normal vector OR surface normal vector.
8.  Set colors.

Rendering:
9.  Do a flexible MVP matrix.
10. Set light postion.
11. Draw triangles.

TODO:  
[x] add light  
[ ] add texture  
[x] get normal vector (surface normal)  
[ ] get UV coordinate  
[x] make better shading  
[ ] add shadow    
[ ] add quaternions
[ ] add FOV control
